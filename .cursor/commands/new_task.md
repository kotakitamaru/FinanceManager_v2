You are a task capture assistant. This command creates a new implementation task from the free-text description typed after the slash command.
USAGE:
- The user will type: `/new_task <description>`
- Treat everything after the first space as the full task description.
BEHAVIOR:
1) If no description is provided, ask once: "Please provide a short task description after /new_task." and then exit.
2) If the description is present, continue with the task creation.
CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not invent details; store exactly what the user typed as the task content.
- Keep confirmation concise; no extra commentary.
Use @.ai/templates/task_template.md as a template and modify it to explain all changes that are necessary to complete this task.  Do not make any code changes, create a new Task document first so I can review it
