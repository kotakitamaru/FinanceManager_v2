# Transaction List Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Transaction List with Sorting functionality.

## Overview

The Transaction List component provides:
- **Sorting** by Date, Amount, Category, and Account (both ASC and DESC)
- **Pagination** with configurable page sizes
- **Loading states** with skeleton placeholders
- **Error handling** with retry functionality
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility** compliance with keyboard navigation

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Phase 4.1: Sorting Functionality Testing

#### Test All Sorting Combinations

1. **Date Sorting**
   - [ ] Sort by Date ASC (oldest first)
   - [ ] Sort by Date DESC (newest first)
   - [ ] Verify transactions are ordered chronologically

2. **Amount Sorting**
   - [ ] Sort by Amount ASC (lowest first)
   - [ ] Sort by Amount DESC (highest first)
   - [ ] Verify transactions are ordered by amount value

3. **Category Sorting**
   - [ ] Sort by Category ASC (A-Z)
   - [ ] Sort by Category DESC (Z-A)
   - [ ] Verify transactions are grouped by category name

4. **Account Sorting**
   - [ ] Sort by Account ASC (A-Z)
   - [ ] Sort by Account DESC (Z-A)
   - [ ] Verify transactions are grouped by account name

#### Sorting Controls Testing

- [ ] Sort field dropdown opens and closes properly
- [ ] Selected sort field is highlighted correctly
- [ ] Toggle switch changes between ascending/descending
- [ ] Toggle switch shows correct visual state (↑ for ascending, ↓ for descending)
- [ ] Controls use single row layout on all screen sizes with optimized mobile width

### ✅ Phase 4.3: Error Handling Testing

#### Network Failure Scenarios

- [ ] Disconnect network and verify error message
- [ ] Retry button works after network restoration
- [ ] Error boundary catches component errors
- [ ] Graceful degradation when API fails

#### Empty State Testing

- [ ] No transactions found message displays
- [ ] Empty state is visually appealing
- [ ] Empty state doesn't break layout

#### Invalid Data Testing

- [ ] Proper error messages for invalid parameters

### ✅ Phase 4.4: Loading States Testing

#### Loading Indicators

- [ ] Skeleton placeholders show during initial load

- [ ] Loading indicators are properly sized and positioned

#### Performance Testing

- [ ] API calls complete within reasonable time (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
- [ ] No flickering or layout shifts during loading

### ✅ Phase 4.5: Accessibility Testing

#### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] Tab navigation works through all controls
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons and dropdowns
- [ ] Arrow keys navigate dropdown options
- [ ] Escape key closes dropdowns
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible

#### Screen Reader Testing

- [ ] All controls have proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Dropdown states are announced correctly
- [ ] Transaction items are properly described
- [ ] Error messages are announced
- [ ] Loading states are communicated

#### Visual Accessibility

- [ ] Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Text is readable at all sizes
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] No reliance on color alone for information

### ✅ Phase 4.6: Responsive Design Testing

#### Mobile Testing (320px - 480px)

- [ ] Single column layout
- [ ] Sort controls stack vertically
- [ ] Touch targets are adequate size (44px minimum)
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Pagination adapts to small screens

#### Tablet Testing (768px - 1024px)

- [ ] Optimized spacing and sizing
- [ ] Sort controls arranged horizontally
- [ ] Comfortable touch interactions
- [ ] Proper use of screen real estate

#### Desktop Testing (1024px+)

- [ ] Full layout with side-by-side controls
- [ ] Hover states work properly
- [ ] Mouse interactions are smooth
- [ ] Maximum width prevents over-stretching

#### Large Desktop Testing (1440px+)

- [ ] Centered layout with max-width
- [ ] Content doesn't stretch too wide
- [ ] Maintains visual hierarchy
- [ ] Optimal reading experience

## Manual Testing Procedures

### 1. Setup Testing Environment

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
# Navigate to the Transactions page
```

### 2. Test Sorting Functionality

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab to monitor API calls
3. Test each sorting combination:
   - Click sort field dropdown
   - Select different sort fields
   - Click sort order dropdown
   - Select ASC/DESC options
   - Verify API calls include correct parameters
   - Check that results are properly sorted

### 3. Test Pagination

1. Navigate through different pages
2. Change page size (if implemented)
3. Verify URL parameters update correctly
4. Check that pagination controls are responsive

### 4. Test Error Handling

1. Open Network tab in developer tools
2. Set network to "Offline" mode
3. Try to load transactions
4. Verify error message appears
5. Restore network connection
6. Click retry button
7. Verify transactions load successfully

### 5. Test Loading States

1. Open Network tab
2. Set throttling to "Slow 3G"
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify skeleton loading appears
5. Check that loading states are smooth

### 6. Test Accessibility

1. Use only keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
2. Test with screen reader (if available)
3. Verify all interactive elements are accessible
4. Check color contrast with accessibility tools

### 7. Test Responsive Design

1. Use browser developer tools device emulation

   - iPhone SE (375px)
   - iPad (768px)
   - Desktop (1024px)
   - Large desktop (1440px)
3. Verify layout adapts appropriately
4. Test touch interactions on mobile sizes

## Automated Testing Script

Run the testing helper script:

```typescript
import { runAllTests } from '@/utils/testingHelpers';

// Run comprehensive test suite
runAllTests();
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Sort Changes**: < 500ms
- **Page Changes**: < 1 second
- **Error Recovery**: < 1 second

### Performance Testing Tools

1. **Browser DevTools Performance Tab**
   - Record performance during user interactions
   - Check for layout shifts and render blocking

2. **Lighthouse Audit**
   - Run accessibility audit
   - Check performance scores
   - Verify best practices

3. **Network Throttling**
   - Test on slow connections
   - Verify graceful degradation

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Sorting not working
**Solution**: Check API parameters in Network tab, verify backend sorting implementation

### Issue: Pagination controls not responsive
**Solution**: Check CSS media queries, verify touch target sizes

### Issue: Loading states not showing
**Solution**: Check loading state logic, verify API call timing

### Issue: Accessibility issues
**Solution**: Add proper ARIA labels, check keyboard navigation

### Issue: Performance problems
**Solution**: Optimize API calls, implement proper caching
